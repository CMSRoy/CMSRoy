- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CMSRoy. I'm a geophysicist currently working in the field of geotechnics at the Technical University Bergakademie Freiberg.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming; mostly in Python and C, sometimes also C++ for solving geotechnical and geophysical problems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Arduino platform together with Raspberry Pi Pico.
